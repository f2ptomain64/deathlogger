# Death Logger
Takes a screenshot of deaths during Theater of Blood and Chambers of Xeric. Also supports discord webhook integration.

Thanks to ejedev for inspiration

This plugin saves by default a photo of a TOB or COX death to a folder called "Wall of Shame."
This is not malicious and your webhook will never be sent to anyone else. That's all there is to it.
